      <title>Asymmetrical Mismatch Negativities to Socially-Marked Biological Sounds</title>
      <link>https://robpetrosino.github.io/publication/mmns/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study explores to what extent social cognition impacts early auditory processing. We measured the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) response to three non-linguistic biological sounds (flatulence, coughs and sniffs) that differ in terms of social markedness: flatulence is socially marked, while coughs and sniffs are not. We found that the MMN to the pairing flatulence/cough is larger when flatulence is the oddball than when cough is the oddball – an asymmetrical MMN. We found no evidence of an asymmetrical MMN for the pairing cough/sniff. Crucially, this pattern tracks the social-markedness properties of these stimuli, but does not track their physical properties. The MMN response has long been used for research in language and music; these results suggest that it may also be used for research in social cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More than Islands of Regularity: An Investigation of the Sensitivity of Morphological Decomposition to Higher-level Linguistic Properties</title>
      <link>https://robpetrosino.github.io/publication/dissertation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A wealth of psycholinguistic evidence has shown that words, before being visually recognized, decompose into smaller units which seem to correspond to morphemes (Rastle et al. 2000, Rastle et al. 2004). Such a procedure of &lt;em&gt;morphological decomposition&lt;/em&gt; seems to occur in words that are made of more than one morpheme, independently of whether they are semantically transparent (e.g., &lt;em&gt;driver&lt;/em&gt;, which means &amp;lsquo;someone who drives&amp;rsquo;) or not (e.g., &lt;em&gt;brother&lt;/em&gt;, which does not mean &amp;lsquo;someone who broths&amp;rsquo;). Decomposition, however, does not seem to occur in words that contain a root plus an additional, non-morphemic string (e.g., &lt;em&gt;brothel&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;el&lt;/em&gt; is not an English suffix). Current models of visual word processing assume the morpho-orthographic decomposition hypothesis, whereby decomposition obligatorily relies on &lt;em&gt;islands of regularity&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; namely, statistical orthographic regularities across letter strings, so that a string such as &lt;em&gt;er&lt;/em&gt; is detected as a single morpho-orthographic unit, but &lt;em&gt;el&lt;/em&gt; is not (Rastle &amp;amp; Davis 2008). As such, decomposition is also argued to occur at early stages of word processing and &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; contact with the lexicon &amp;mdash; namely, before semantic information is accessed, so that decomposition occurs regardless of semantic transparency. This dissertation builds on these findings and primarily elicits the visual masked priming response to test the sensitivity of decomposition to any of the following higher-level linguistic properties (in addition to islands of regularities): phono-orthographic syllabification (along with whole-word lexicality, though indirectly), whole-word frequency, phonological conditioning, and syntactic selectional restrictions. By doing so, this dissertation additionally provides insights regarding the unfolding of linguistic properties during visual word processing. The results reported here suggest that decomposition is affected by whole-word lexicality and whole-word frequency. Given that these two properties are generally considered to be accessed at late stages of processing, these findings seem to be arguing against current models. A model of early visual decomposition is proposed that is able to account for these findings without necessarily challenging the  morpho-orthographic decomposition hypothesis. In this model, decomposition accesses whole-word lexicality and frequency through a multi-step mechanism that first generates multiple possible morpho-orthographic decomposition patterns of the visual stimulus and then evaluates them in parallel in order to choose the optimal candidate for activation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Allomorphy at Italian determiners at the morphology-phonology interface</title>
      <link>https://robpetrosino.github.io/publication/italian-determiners/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Allomorphic alternations are often accounted for by assuming them to be listed as idiosyncratic lexical entries. This paper analyzes the forms of the determiners (definite, indefinite, and demostratives) and definite prepositions across all Italo-Romance varieties, to show that such a view (for a review on accounts for the definite determiner, see Garrapa 2011) may lead to lose crucial generalizations at the morpho-phonological interface. Here, I propose a novel alternative account couched in the framework of &lt;em&gt;Distributed Morphology&lt;/em&gt; (Halle &amp;amp; Marantz1993), which makes use of morpho&amp;ndash;phonological operations, such as positive instructions (&lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt;), or &lt;em&gt;repairs&lt;/em&gt; triggered in response to violations of active &lt;em&gt;filters&lt;/em&gt; (Calabrese, 2009). I show that such an account is able to catch the underlying morpho&amp;ndash;phonological generalizations and therefore more coherently explain allomorphic phenomena occurring in the D&amp;ndash;domain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The left periphery fragmented: Evidence from Italian</title>
      <link>https://robpetrosino.github.io/publication/lp-fragmented/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;published in:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of NELS 48&lt;/em&gt;_ (edited by Sherry Hucklebridge and Max Nelson), 221-231. University of Iceland, Reykjavjk. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartography assumes that syntactic structures are more complex than the usual functional phrases; for example, CP is arguably made up of several projections, each of which is assigned specific scope-discourse features (such as focus and topic; Rizzi 1997). This paper contributes to the debate raging over whether all cartographic projections are always present. By looking at cross-clausal A-binding conditions in Italian, I show that an anaphor can be bound across clauses only when at the outmost phasal edge. This ultimately provides evidence that the full cartographic CP domain may not always be projected.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Greek Root Allomorphy without Spans</title>
      <link>https://robpetrosino.github.io/publication/spans/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://robpetrosino.github.io/publication/spans/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we focus on a set of data from Greek root-allomorphy that has been recently presented by Merchant (2015) as a counterexample to the strong hypothesis from Embick (2010) that linear adjacency between the trigger and the target is required for morphosyntactically-conditioned allomorphy to arise. We take issue with Merchant&amp;rsquo;s proposed alternative hypothesis which essentially eliminates adjacency as a locality condition for allomorphy, due to the fact that one such solution leads to the loss of a striking (and not language-specific) implicational generalization, namely, that root-allomorphy never occurs in the presence of overt verbalizers, a straightforward blocking effect under the linear adjacency hypothesis. We propose an alternative account of the problematic cases of Greek root-allomorphy, whereby ASP and VCE form a single node via post-syntactic re-bracketing, allowing us to save the linear adjacency hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
